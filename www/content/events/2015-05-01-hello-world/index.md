### Adopting GraphQL + Apollo in an existing Redux application

There are a lot of reasons your team wants to use GraphQL to interact with your data, but you already have a robust Redux REST API integration. Luckily there are several ways to get started with GraphQL without completely rewriting your app!

- How flexible should your styles be?
- How can you support WCAG AA accessibility?
- Does everything have to forward refs?
